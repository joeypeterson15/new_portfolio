export const About_Me = "Whether it's chemistry, music or computer programming, \
I've always had a deep love to learn. As a web developer with a background in Python, Node.js, and frameworks such as Express and React, \
I leverage my scientific and artistic background to develop clean and optimized code. \
My professional background demonstrates my ability to perform at the highest levels under pressure, \
to work collaboratively and independently, to communicate clearly, and to approach problems analytically. \
I approach my work with a positive, can-do attitude and excel in outside-the-box thinking environments."
